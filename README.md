# iot-fan-control
 

This project is an **Arduino-based automatic fan control system** that adjusts the fan's speed according to the surrounding temperature. It utilizes a **temperature sensor (e.g., LM35 or DHT11)** to continuously monitor the ambient temperature and a **PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) signal** to regulate the fan speed.  

### **Key Features**:  
- **Automatic Adjustment**: The fan's speed increases as the temperature rises, ensuring optimal cooling.  
- **Energy Efficiency**: Reduces power consumption by running the fan at lower speeds when the temperature is low.  
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Continuously measures temperature to maintain comfort and efficiency.  
- **User-Friendly Operation**: Pre-programmed thresholds allow the system to operate without manual intervention.  

### **Components Used**:  
1. **Arduino Uno/Nano**: Microcontroller for processing sensor data.  
2. **Temperature Sensor**: Measures the surrounding temperature (e.g., LM35 or DHT11).  
3. **DC Fan**: The load controlled by the system.  
4. **Transistor or MOSFET**: Used as a switch to control fan speed.  
5. **PWM Signal**: Adjusts voltage to regulate fan speed.  
6. **Power Supply**: To power the Arduino and fan.  

### **Applications**:  
- Smart home systems for efficient cooling.  
- Industrial applications for temperature-sensitive processes.  
- Energy-efficient designs for green buildings.  

This project is an excellent demonstration of how **automation** and **embedded systems** can improve everyday conveniences while promoting energy efficiency.
